## Description

Based on example 4, creates and positions the player using preloads and loadJSON files.

This maze game has 3 levels, each having two collectibles: Pink Powerups and Purple Coins. The pink powerups give a temporary pink glow to the player, while the coins give 100 points and only last on teh board for 15 seconds. Players must get to the end to progress between each level

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Loads JSON levels (preload)
- Builds Level objects
- Creates/positions the Player
- Handles input + level switching

It is intentionally light on "details" because those are moved into:

- Level.js (grid + drawing + tile meaning)
- Player.js (position + movement rules)
